Option A - BC Liquor app

In this revised version of the BC Liquor app, I added a logo in the application. Besides, I introduced an overview dashboard for the app where users can have a general idea of the data content of this app. Majorly, people get to know from which countries are we examing the liquor data. Moreover, I've added three functional features. The first is to show the overall results after filtering. The second one is to enable table downloading. And the third is to filter data by sweetness and Alcohol content.
